## Exp_07 - Attach a File to an Assistant
<br>

### Objective
- Create simple php code to attach a file to an assistant

### Notes
- Simply uploading a file to OpenAi is not enough. In order for the assistant to be able to access a file, that file needs to be attached to the assistant.
- The file and assistant have already been created on OpenAi.
- On OpenAi, when you click on the assistant you will see the id of the attached file at the very bottom.
