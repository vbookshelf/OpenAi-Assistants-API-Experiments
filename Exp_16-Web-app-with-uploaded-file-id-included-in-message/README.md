## Exp_16 - Create a working web app that includes the uploaded file id in the message
<br>

### Objective
- In addition to attaching the uploaded file to the assistant, include the file id in the message
  
### Notes
- The assistant id needs to be replaced before running the app.
- The API key needs to be replaced before running the app.
- The folder called "uploads" must also be uploded to the web server.
- Adding the file id to the message did not improve the ability of the assistant to find and read file contents.
