## Exp_03 - File upload to Web Server and then transfer to OpenAi Assistants
<br>

### Objective
- Upload a file to a web server.
- Transfer the file from the web server to OpenAi assistants.

### Notes
- OpenAI Assistants can read and process files.
- There are two folders in this repo. One contains the code to upload the file to a web server. The other contains code to transfer the file to OpenAi.
- In a chat app these two steps would be combined into one.
- The web apps in each of the folders need to be running on the web server in order for the code to work.
