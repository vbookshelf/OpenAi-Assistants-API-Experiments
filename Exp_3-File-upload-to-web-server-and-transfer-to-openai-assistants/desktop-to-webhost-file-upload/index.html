	<p>This web app, including Javascript and php files, must be on the server for the upload to work.<br>
		You will first need to create a folder called 'upoads' on the server, or the upload won't work.<br>
	After upload is completed, you may need to close and reopen Filezilla before the uploaded file will
appear in the folder called 'uploads'.</p>
