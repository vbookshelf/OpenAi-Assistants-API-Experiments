# OpenAi Assistants API Experiments
My experiments with the OpenAi Assistants API

These experiments use Javascript to interact with the OpenAi API. This is because Javascript web apps can be run from the desktop by simply double clicking the index.html file. This is ideal when building assistants (i.e. ChatGPT chatbots) for your own personal use.
