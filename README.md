# OpenAi Assistants API Experiments - Javascript and Php
My experiments with the OpenAi Assistants API

These experiments use Javascript and Php to interact with the OpenAi API. This makes it possible to host a web app Assistant on a low cost shared server, because shared servers have Php pre-installed. When using Python, for example, one would need to rent a server and then install Python on it. That server is a lot more expensive and takes more work to set up and maintain.
